# Galvanic-Skin-Response
A group project to develop a stress detection prototype using Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors. The device measures skin conductance, which varies with sweat gland activity linked to stress levels along with body temperature, pulse rate and spo2 level. My role focused on documentation, research, and compiling the final report.
