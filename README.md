# Galvanic-Skin-Response
A group project to develop a stress detection prototype using Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors. The device measures skin conductance, which varies with sweat gland activity linked to stress levels along with body temperature, pulse rate and spo2 level. My role focused on documentation, research, and compiling the final report.

# Stress Level Indicator

A group project designed to detect and display human stress levels using biosensors and electronics.

## ðŸ”§ Objective

To create a simple prototype that can monitor stress using physiological parameters like pulse or skin conductance.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Role

- This project was done collaboratively with team members contributing to electronics, coding, and design.
- **My contribution** was focused on:
  - Writing and compiling the project documentation and final report
  - Researching theoretical aspects of stress detection
  - Coordinating the project timeline and deliverables
